            <div class="content">
              <p>The conventional corporate way of building websites is to first plan perfectly, get approval, design, build, test and only go live when everything is perfect. This takes ages, is very expensive and integrates no user feedback. Instead we work with light-weight AGILE methodogies. There is no need for planning, we simply start on it today. We will strip down your website to the minimum viable product and push that version live as soon as we can. Only then we focus on improving the website. Iteration after iteration we will add more content, add features, make the website mobile responsive, optimize for Google, and so on. Working AGILE feels natural. It's light, fast, fun, cheap, helps you focus on the core features and allows you to get live feedback from users how to improve in the next iterations.</p>

              <p>Websites are built for users. We leave out our egos. We focus on understanding WHO will visit our website, WHAT they want to do and WHY. These are called "user stories" and your website will have multiple. Some users will be new to the website and need to be introduced and to sign up, returning visitors simply want to log in and go straight to what they where looking for.</p>
              <p>Every single pixel of your website should contribute to one of your user stories. If a part doesn't, chances are you can leave it out of the website and nobody will miss it. Optimize your navigation, the structure, reduce text by 50% and then again, add colour coding, choose the right words, improve the flow, leave out the unnecessary.</p>

              <p>Nabu is the Babylonian god of scribes and the patron of writing and wisdom. He is often depicted holding a stylus, one of the first tools for writing. Wisdom is ment to be eternalised and passed on through writing, often using mythological stories. We no longer use a stylus to write, nor do we use a pen. Today we code. Stories are told through code, through websites! If any, Nabu is no less than the patron of us coders. How awesome is that?! Today we have our own myths and today information flows freely using ever evolving technologies. What better way to honour Nabu ...</p>

            <p>
                    Built for a multinational company which specializes in soldering chemistry for electronics. This is the most complex NABU website. It gets about 16.000 visits per year, it hosts about 200 PDFs, 50 products, 40 contacts, is managed by multiple people and translated in 10 languages. All of this is powered Drupal. This website replaces the dinosaur website that no longer belonged in the age of mobile. It was time for a new elan, a new style and a revival. Interflux launched the idea that the new website should have as many languages as languages their customers speak. That is 27 languages! So far we have 10. This is to reach out to more people, because English speakers are still rare in many countries.</p>
            <p>A funny problem is that Inteflux has seriously unsexy products. That is why the new website is intentionally more vivid, bright and modern to make the products look a bit more sexy. The website also fits perfectly on tablets and is optimized for touch. Interflux decided to replace all paper catalogues with tablets with our website on it. Unlike paper, the website is alwyas up-to-date, is multilingual, eco-friendly, cheaper and doesn't require reprinting every few months. Customers are stunned to simply get a tablet instead of a catalogue :)</p>

            <p>Medisites is the predecessor of NABU websites. Medisites specialised in websites for medical practices. As Medisites grew in exposure and experience, we soon started to attract also non-medical projects and thus a new name was needed, hence NABU websites. Launched in 2010.</p>
