        <p>The website features a luxurious look and feel to match the exclusivity of the crystal, a custom-made logo, CSS3 animations and a mobile responsive grid. The later makes sure the website will adapt and fit on any screen size, wheter it is your phone, tablet or laptop. The content is loaded with Google's SEO-friendly AJAX techniques to avoid page loads, to allow smooth page transition and still rank good on Google. Launched in 2014.</p>

        </h2>
        <p>
            Built for a multinational company which specializes in soldering chemistry for electronics. This is the most complex NABU website. It gets about 16.000 visits per year, it hosts about 200 PDFs, 50 products, 40 contacts, is managed by multiple people and translated in 10 languages. All of this is powered Drupal. This website replaces the dinosaur website that no longer belonged in the age of mobile. It was time for a new elan, a new style and a revival. Interflux launched the idea that the new website should have as many languages as languages their customers speak. That is 27 languages! So far we have 10. This is to reach out to more people, because English speakers are still rare in many countries.</p>
        <p>A funny problem is that Inteflux has seriously unsexy products. That is why the new website is intentionally more vivid, bright and modern to make the products look a bit more sexy. The website also fits perfectly on tablets and is optimized for touch. Interflux decided to replace all paper catalogues with tablets with our website on it. Unlike paper, the website is alwyas up-to-date, is multilingual, eco-friendly, cheaper and doesn't require reprinting every few months. Customers are stunned to simply get a tablet instead of a catalogue :)</p>

That means he will be preparing and joining expedition teams to venture through the arctics, desserts, jungles and mountains. This website will help him kick-start that idea and to get international exposure. Launched in 2012.</p>

        <p>How can we tell people that we build great websites if we don't have the badest website of them all? That is why we have applied everything we have ever learned to this website. This website features: iconic custom fonts, CSS3 animations, strong bold graphic design, elegant object-oriented jQuery code, HTML5 semantics, sprited images, progressive JPGs, AJAX-friendly SEO, UX-wise big headlines, UX-optimized navigation, a smart preloader, exotic domain names (.io is <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/1rfBz" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this island</a>), mythological brand name, a mascot rhino that blinks, authenticity, originality and nothing but love for websites. In the spirit of Nabu, this website pushes all boundries and wanders outside the boxes we ought to obey.</p>

It attracts visitors internationally from Japan, USA, Canada, France, Germany, Australia, Belgium and more.

        <p>Medisites is the predecessor of NABU websites. Medisites specialised in websites for medical practices. As Medisites grew in exposure and experience, we soon started to attract also non-medical projects and thus a new name was needed, hence NABU websites. Launched in 2010.</p>
