            <p>In 2013 between 10% and 20% of our websites where visited using smart phones and tablets. More than ever it has become important to make websites mobile responsive. That means that the website will morph according to the size of your screen. On mobile phones you will see the mobile-friendly touch-enabled version of your website and on computers the normal version.</p>

            <p>There are many ridiculous design rules out there. Do let them inspire you, they always have a core of truth, but please make up your own mind. Be bold enough to do things your way. Don't ever limit your creative thinking with rules. Anything goes. Just like in fashion, it doesn't really matter what you wear, it's how you pull it off.</p>

            <p>The conventional corporate way of building websites is to first plan perfectly, get approval, design, build, test and only go live when everything is perfect. This takes ages, is very expensive and integrates no user feedback. Instead we work with light-weight AGILE methodogies. There is no need for planning, we simply start on it today. We will strip down your website to the minimum viable product and push that version live as soon as we can. Only then we focus on improving the website. Iteration after iteration we will add more content, add features, make the website mobile responsive, optimize for Google, and so on. Working AGILE feels natural. It's light, fast, fun, cheap, helps you focus on the core features and allows you to get live feedback from users how to improve in the next iterations.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Websites are built for users. We leave out our egos. We focus on understanding WHO will visit our website, WHAT they want to do and WHY. These are called "user stories" and your website will have multiple. Some users will be new to the website and need to be introduced and to sign up, returning visitors simply want to log in and go straight to what they where looking for.</p>
            <p>Every single pixel of your website should contribute to one of your user stories. If a part doesn't, chances are you can leave it out of the website and nobody will miss it. Optimize your navigation, the structure, reduce text by 50% and then again, add colour coding, choose the right words, improve the flow, leave out the unnecessary.</p>

            <p>Use the nonverbals: images, fonts, colours, symbols, spacing, sizes, contrast, controversy, interaction and animations. These are the body language of your websites. Words can only say so much. The are like the tone of your voice, the clothes you wear, your posture, all contributing to the message you are trying to share.</p>

            <p>Nobody really reads websites, we scan them for big headlines, images and clickable elements. We demand instant information, instant interaction. Especially the homepage of a website should instantly establish who this website is of, what they do and most importantly what they can do for the visitor. If one doesn't find what they want in 7 seconds, you lose a visitor.</p>

        </h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Nabu is the Babylonian god of scribes and the patron of writing and wisdom. He is often depicted holding a stylus, one of the first tools for writing. Wisdom is ment to be eternalised and passed on through writing, often using mythological stories. We no longer use a stylus to write, nor do we use a pen. Today we code. Stories are told through code, through websites! If any, Nabu is no less than the patron of us coders. How awesome is that?! Today we have our own myths and today information flows freely using ever evolving technologies. What better way to honour Nabu ...</p>

            <p>Average has never conquered anyone's heart, nor has a critic ever been raised a statue. Stand up for what you believe, be bold, share your story, dare dream out loud, dare choose a side, dare do it your way, dare kick in some doors, don't be afraid to pick a fight. When you do, you'll find that others who agree with you will rally to your side and that you too can leave a dent on the universe.</p>
